# Luna-OS
Kernel Mode Gaming Operating System

Kernel is Public Domain, however, the uFat library is BSD. 

It makes use of pdlibc which is Public Domain as well. 

MicroGL and PortableGL follow their own respective licensing. 

PortableGL will be replaced with LunaGL (a Public Domain implementation of the OpenGL 3.0 standard)

A library named rUgly that we're developing will be the Public Domain replacement for uFat.
